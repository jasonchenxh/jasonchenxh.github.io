I am currently a postgraduate student majoring in Resources and Environmental Engineering (Safety Engineering) at [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). Before this I graduated as a Bachelor in Safety Engineering student at [Northeastern University (NEU)](https://www.neu.edu.cn/) in the year 2022. 

I am seeking a PhD opportunity for Fall 2025. My research interests include computational fluid dynamics (CFD), artificial intelligence (AI), Safety Science and Engineering, Simulation, Modelling and Numerical Methods. If you are interested in me, feel free to read my CV via the [link](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
